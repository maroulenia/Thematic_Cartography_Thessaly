**Thematic Cartography of Thessaly – Interactive Web Map**

This repository contains an interactive web-based thematic map of the Thessaly region (Greece), developed in the context of an academic project on thematic cartography.

The application visualizes population data using multiple cartographic techniques, including:
- Choropleth map
- Dasymetric map
- Proportional symbols
- Isopleth map (population potential)
- Dot density map
- Administrative boundaries

The map is built with MapLibre GL JS and uses GeoJSON datasets for all spatial layers.
Users can interactively toggle layers, adjust symbology parameters, and switch basemaps

→ Population data are based on the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) of the year 2021
